  <h3>The Task</h3>
  <p>
    My group and I were tasked with designing an interface for a startup of our
    choice. We selected the Museum of Future Experiences (MoFE), a startup in
    NYC that creates four custom virtual reality adventures for each customer.
    Visitors select one each time they come to the museum, and are immersed in
    an hour-long experience meant to encourage self-reflection. Intrigued by
    the challenge of designing for VR, we decided to design their headset interface.

  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    First, we sketched four different designs in Balsamiq, since it is important
    to choose the right design before getting the design right (in the words of
    Bill Buxton). Then, we selected the design that seemed to most intuitive, and
    created high-fidelity, interactive mockups in Figma.
