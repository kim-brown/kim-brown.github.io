    The Task</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="img/VR/balsamiq1.png" align="left" style="margin-right:30px; height: 400px; width: 300px">
    My group and I were tasked with designing an interface for a startup of our
    choice. We selected the Museum of Future Experiences (MoFE), a startup in
    NYC that creates four custom virtual reality adventures for each customer.
    Visitors select one each time they come to the museum, and are immersed in
    an hour-long experience meant to encourage self-reflection. Intrigued by
    the challenge of designing for VR, we decided to design their headset interface.
  </p>
  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="img/VR/balsamiq2.png" align="right" style="margin-left:30px; height: 400px; width: 300px">
    First, we sketched four different designs in Balsamiq. Then, we selected the
    design that seemed to most intuitive.
    We created high-fidelity, interactive mockups in Figma. Our mockups were
    reviewed in a class critique session, where we recieved feedback indicating
    that certain aspects of our design were unclear (for instance, that a user
    could not go back and select another journey). We remedied that by adding
    a modal dialogue after a user clicks on an adventure asking them to confirm
    their choice.
  </p>
  <h3>Feedback</h3>
  <p>
    I submitted our interactive mockup to UserTesting.com, and wrote a series of
    prompts and questions to elicit feedback. We saw that the users had some
    confusion about which elements were interactive and which were not, such as
    trying to use the bottom bar indicating where they were in the onboarding
    process to navigate. They also suggested that
    incorporating instructions at the beginning of the actual VR experience
    would have been a more interesting and more helpful way to offer
    onboarding.
  </p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    Having done this assignment, I am more able to appreciate the value of
    user testing. While previously it had seemed that we would be able to guess
    how people would perform and the interface seemed straightforward to us, we
    had background knowledge that users will not have. Additionally, I learned
    that it's best to combine functionality and visual representation as best
    as possible (for example, instead of having a fast forward button and a
    progress bar, have a progress slider).

    Starting
    with one carefully-selected design and iteratively improving it through
    feedback seems like the best approach to creating a design from scratch.
