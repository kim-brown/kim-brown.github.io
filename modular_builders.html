  <h1>Modular Builders Website Design + Implementation</h1>

  <h3>The Task</h3>
  <p>
    My Dad, a small business owner, has been using
    <a href="http://www.modularbuildersnj.com/" target="_blank">
      the same website</a> since the early 2000s.
     Once I began learning HTML and CSS, I asked him if he
    would like me to build a new site for him. He said yes, so I combed through
    his site for the most crucial information and drew up a new website map.
    I organized most of the content through dropdown navigation tools
    (specifications and floor plans) so that it was all easily accessible in one
    place. <img class="inline-photos" src="img/modular_build1.png" align="right"></img>
    I also collected his previous work on one page, using CSS grid.
  </p>
  <h3>Feedback</h3>
  <p>
    When I showed my Dad the first iteration of the website, he loved its clean
  appearance and easy navigation. However, he wanted to include more
  content, such as relevant deals and more information about his prior work.
  We are currently working on the second iteration.

  </p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    This project helped me to feel more confident about my web programming abilities.
    I also realized the importance of communicating with who you
    are designing for at every step of the process, rather than making assumptions
    and needing to backtrack as a result.
