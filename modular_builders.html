  <h1>Modular Builders Website Design + Implementation</h1>

      Check out the first draft here

  <h3>The Task</h3>
  <p>
    My Dad, a small business owner, has been using
    <a href="http://www.modularbuildersnj.com/" target="_blank">
      the same website</a> since the early 2000s.
     Once I began learning HTML and CSS, I asked him if he
    would like me to build a new site for him. He said yes, so I combed through
    his website for the most crucial information and drew out a new website map.
    I organized most of the content through dropdown navigation tools
    (specifications and floor plans) so that it was all easily accessible in one
    place. <img class="inline-photos" src="img/modular_build1.png" align="right"></img>
    I also collected the work showcased by the sight on one page using
    CSS grid.
  </p>
  <h3>Feedback</h3>
  <p>
    When I showed my Dad the first iteration of the website, he loved its clean
  appearance and easy navigation. However, he said he wanted to include more
  content, such as relevant deals and more information about his prior work.
  We are currently working on the second iteration of the site.

  </p>
  <h3>Final Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    This project helped me to grow more confident in my abilities to create a
    website. I also realized the importance of talking with who you
    are designing for at every step of the process, rather than making assumptions
    and needing to backtrack as a result.
