  <h3>The Task</h3>
  <p>
    After going off meal plan, I realized just how overwhelmed I was at
    the task of feeding myself a varied diet. I only knew a few recipes and felt
    like drawing up a grocery list and deciding what to feed myself three times
    a day, every day was taking up time and energy I wanted to spend on other
    things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since learning Symfony in my Web Technologies class, I felt confident getting
    started on a Laravel web app that could generate a week-long meal plan,
    leveraging the <a href="https://developer.edamam.com/" target="_blank">
      Edamam Nutrition API</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app stores user information locally (in MySQL), and allows each user to
    save their meal plan, favorite foods, and staple recipes. It also generates
    a grocery list for them out of all the recipes in their meal plan and allows
    them to suppress recipes for certain meals and refresh recipes to see
    something different.
  </p>

  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    I have gained a better understanding of full-stack development through this
    project and intend to keep adding new functionality to it.
