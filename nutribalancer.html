  <h3>The Task</h3>
  <p>
    After going off meal plan, I realized just how overwhelmed I was at
    the task of feeding myself a varied diet. I only knew a few recipes and felt
    like drawing up a grocery list and deciding what to feed myself three times
    a day, every day was taking up time and energy I wanted to spend on other
    things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since learning Symfony in my Web Technologies class, I felt confident getting
    started on a Laravel web app that could generate a week-long meal plan,
    leveraging the <a href="https://developer.edamam.com/" target="_blank">
      Edamam Nutrition API</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app stores user information locally (in MySQL), and allows each user to
    save meal plans, favorite foods, and staple recipes. It also generates
    a grocery list and nutrition summary for the week. Users can
    strikethrough recipes to remove their ingredients from the
    grocery list, or refresh recipes to see something new.
  </p>

  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    I have gained a better understanding of full-stack development through this
    project and intend to keep adding new functionality to it.

      Users can refresh to generate a new recipe, cross the meal off their list,
      or click to be brought to the recipe. The images at the top are from the
      recipes in their plan.

    <p>
      The app auto-generates a grocery list based on the meals in the plan.
      The numbers next to the ingredients indicate the meals they belong to.
      Users can also edit the foods they like to appear in morning/evening meals.
