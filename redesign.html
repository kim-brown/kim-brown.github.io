  <h3>The Task</h3>
  <p>

    A partner and I wanted to redesign the Craigslist website to be cleaner and
    easier to navigate, as well as responsive to different devices and screen sizes.

  </p>
  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="img/redesign2.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 30px; width: 450px; height: 350px">
    We first created wire frames of a few of the website's
    pages. Once satisfied with the design, we drew out a diagram of how elements
    should be change in response to changing screen sizes. We went on to create
    a high-fidelity mockup of the site on Proto.io, and then I created the responsive
    version of the "add-listing" page using HTML and CSS.
  </p>
  <h3>Final Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    This project was a great opportunity to learn about being conscious of and
    implementing responsive design.

    In the future, I would make the functionality more central to the design of
    the page, with the most likely tasks being the easiest to do (for example,
    the toolbar allowing users to change between different continents would likely
    not be used very frequently, while one navigating from home to listings would).

    Craigslist may also intentionally maintain a haphazard appearance because
    it allows its users so much freedom; it does not offer verification for the
    sellers and listings. I realized that the goal is not to make every interface
    look clean and polished, but rather to clearly communicate what the user can
    do.
