  <h3>The Task</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="img/redesign1.png" align="right" style="margin-right: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: -200px; width: 350px; height: 250px">
    A partner and I wanted to redesign the Craigslist website to be cleaner and
    easier to navigate, as well as responsive to different devices and screen sizes.

  </p>
  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="img/redesign2.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 30px; width: 450px; height: 350px">
    We first created wireframes of a few of the website's new
    pages. Once satisfied with the design, we drew out a diagram of how elements
    should be change in response to changing screen sizes. We went on to create
    a high-fidelity mockup of the site on Proto.io, and then I created the
    responsive "add listing" page using HTML and CSS.
  </p>
  <h3>Feedback</h3>
  <p>
    We recieved the feedback that we should make functionality more central to the design of
    the page, with the most likely tasks being the easiest to do (for example,
    the toolbar allowing users to change between different continents would likely
    not be used very frequently, while one navigating from home to listings would).
  </p>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    This project was a great opportunity to learn about responsive design.
    However, my Professor pointed out that Craigslist may also intentionally
    maintain a haphazard appearance because it allows users so much freedom.
    They do not want it to seem like the products listed are verified or even safe.
    I realized that the goal is not to make every interface look maximally clean
    and polished, but rather to clearly communicate what the user can do, while
    keeping their best interest in mind, and helping the company achieve its goals.
