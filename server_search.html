      For a class project, a friend and I wanted to create a live-filtering web
      page that would help students locate their favorite servers at Brown's
      Center for Information Technology (CIT). We included the option to sort
      alphabetically and to filter by two criteria: floor and type of name (place,
      character, metal, or food). Additionally, users can search the name of the
      server, favorite servers, and toggle a favorites-only view.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Choices</h3>
    <p>
      We chose a simple, straightforward design that emphasized functionality
      above all. We wanted it to be very clear what mode users were in, so we changed
      the text of the dropdown button when a category was selected. Additionally,
      we wanted it to be easy to tell what was and wasn't favorited, so we changed both the text and
      the color of the buttons to indicate the change.

      <h3>Takeaways</h3>
      This project was a great opportunity to become familiar with React.
      I now have a better understanding of React syntax, and concepts like
      components and props. I am glad that I was able to learn a bit more about making dynamic
      web pages. I also learned the importance of being clear about
      how user interactions are changing the pages by changing text, colors, and
      what is rendered.
