    For a class project, a friend and I wanted to create a live-filtering web
    page that would help students to locate their favorite servers at Brown's
    Center for Information Technology (CIT). We included the option to sort
    alphabetically and to filter by two criteria: floor and type of name (place,
    character, metal, or food). Additionally, users can search the name of the
    server, favorite servers, and render only their favorited servers.

    This project was a great opportunity for me to become familiar with React.
    I now have a better understanding of React syntax, and concepts like
    components and props. I am glad I got to understand a bit more about how to
    make dynamic web pages.
